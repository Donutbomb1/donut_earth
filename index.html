        <h1>WHY DONUT EARTH?</h1>
        <p>You may be saying to yourself that is completely insane. The earth can't be shaped like a donut! That's the shape of a food not a celestial body, but that is just what they what you to think. They present it as a food item to make you say that is is crazy and can't be the same shape as the world in the which  humanity resides. Your first reaction of disbelief and humor should be your first clue that the earth is, in fact, a donut. Why is that so crazy? Because that is how you have been raised and how they want you to think. You need to question why you think that the earth is not a donut. This is what you should be questioning, not if this might be true.</p>

        <h2>A Question of Great Gravity</h2>
        <p>As you grow to accept the reality of the shape of our planet you may have some questions such as what about gravity? This is a simple matter to explain. You can even prove this at your own home. It turns out, Gravity is a myth! It is actually centrifugal force. The donut is in fact spinning and the the force of the spinning keep us pushed on the outside. If you want to see this in action for yourself all you need is a basket or any other container with a handle and a small object that fits into the container. If you spin it very fast in a circle, the object will stay safely in the bag. This is how 'Gravity' functions.</p>

        <h3>We actually live on the inside of the donut</h3>
        <p>Donut Earth is actually hollow, and we live on the inside of the Donut. This is why Centrifugal force can keep us on hold us down to the ground. No one really knows what is on the outside of the donut, except of course for the wizards who live there. You may be asking yourself, what about stars? Turns out, it's just city lights on the other side of the Donut. The  blue sky is also on the other side, but it's actually a massive ocean. If the world were round, all of the air would just leak out into space. Duh.</p>

        <h4>So, who is lying to you?</h4>
        <p>The answer to this is a deceptively easy one, Witches. You along with the vast majority of the planet are ruled by a group of vile witches. These dastardly villains have ruled from the shadows for uncounted years. They can only be combated through the sharing of knowledge to undo their rule. So go, and tell your friends, family, anyone you meet and share the truth. Of course, you can also donate to the Donut Earth Wildlife Fund for Buying Me Cool Stuff. It's a great cause because you get to feel good about donating, and I get cool stuff.</p>

        <h5>So what?</h5>
        <p>Because if the earth is a donut then what else is a lie you need to be ever vigilant. Question all around you and you will begin to see the truth. The donut earth society is trying to bring bring truth into the world and share knowledge.</p>
